Clojure uses data structures to design (modesl, specify) data structures in Clojure.

Clojure has built in data structures that are immutable, so once you create them you cannot change their values.  Rather than being a limiting factor this greatly simplifies the overal design of your code.

# Build in data structures 

The most commonly used data structures for design are maps an d vectors

## Maps

Today, we are going to write a function named `emoji=` that returns an emoji:

1. ðŸ˜ƒ  when two things are equal
2. ðŸ˜¡  when two things are not equal



~~~klipse
{"key string" "value as a string"}
~~~

~~~klipse
{1 "keys can be numbers" 2 2 3 "numbers can be values too"}
~~~

You may nave noticed that we have not used commas to seperate the elements or pairs in the map.  You can add commas if it makes the map more readable.

In Clojure, commas are treated like whitespace, ie. they have no meaning.  Commas are a convienience for humans.  Try delete the commas from the next example

~~~klipse
{1 "keys can be numbers", 2 2, 3 "numbers can be values too"}
~~~

Even without the commas, the map works just fine.


## Using keyworkds with maps
~~~klipse
{:i-am-a-keyword "keywords make maps even easier to use"}
~~~


~~~klipse
{:i-am-a-keyword :keywords-can-be-values-too)
~~~


The most common approach is to use keywords for the keys of a map and either strings, numeric values or other collections for values.



## Collections as map values (nesting)
